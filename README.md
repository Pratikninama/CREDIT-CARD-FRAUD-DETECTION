                                                                                    Introduction

This document outlines the deployment process for the Prediction of credit card fraud project, which aims to predict credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The project follows a structured approach including data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, model selection, training, validation, and deployment.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
1. Data Collection: Collect the time series data from the provided CSV file.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data quality checks, treat missing values, outliers, etc.
3. Data Preprocessing: Get the correct data type for date, balance the data, and perform feature engineering and selection.
4. Model Development: Choose the appropriate model, split the data into train/test sets, and train the model.
5. Model Evaluation: Choose evaluation metrics, validate the model, and assess its performance.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
7. Model Deployment: Plan and execute the deployment of the trained model.
