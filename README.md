This is a Cadboost model that predicts the demand for CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION. The model uses historical credit card user data to make accurate predictions.

Installation
To install and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps: git clone (https://github.com/Pratikninama/CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION/blob/main/Creditcard_fraud_detection.ipynb) pip install -r requirements.txt jupyter notebook

Usage
To use this project, follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter notebook. This will involve loading the necessary data, preprocessing the data, training the model, and making predictions. You can also modify the model parameters and retrain the model to improve its performance.

Data Source
The data used in this project was provided by upgrad-CREDIT CARD.

Model Evaluation
The performance of the model was evaluated using the clasification report. The model achieved an area under curve of 0.85, indicating good performance.

Additionally, the AUC values for the train and test datasets were calculated:

Train dataset AUC of cad boost after 500 iteration: 0.86 ,Test dataset(AVG) : 0.97 

Results
The model was able to accurately predict credit crad fraud on historical credit card data .

Contributors
This project was developed by Pratik Ninama.

Future Work
Some potential ideas for future work on this project include:

Experimenting with different machine learning models and feature engineering techniques to improve performance. Developing a web application or API that allows users to interact with the model and make predictions.
